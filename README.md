# Student-Project-Tracker Web APP
A simple FastAPI web application for registering students and tracking their weekly progress during the Cloud Native Series.

### Key Features:
- Register new students (generates a unique ID).
- Track weekly progress for each student.
- All students use one central MongoDB (hosted on MongoDB Atlas or similar).
- Simple endpoints for registration, status check, and progress update.

## üì¶ Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+ & Pip  
- Git
- MongoDB Atlas account (to get your connection string)
- Docker 
- Kubernetes (kubectl, kind)

## üíª Local Development Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chisomjude/student-project-tracker.git
cd student-project-tracker
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3.Db Connections
- navigate to app/main and update vault IP:

```
   export VAULT_ADDR=""
   export VAULT_ROLE_ID=""
   export VAULT_SECRET_ID="
```

### 4. Run the Application Locally
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```
Visit `http://vmip:8000` to see your app in action.

```

### 3. Push to Docker Hub
Ensure you're logged in:
```bash
docker login
```
Tag and push your image:
